In this game, at the beginning, 
there are n monsters arranged in a row (numbered 0 through n-1 from left to right). 
The i-th monster initially has hi health points. A monster dies if its health points become â‰¤ 0.

Chef is going to perform q actions.
 For each action, Chef chooses two numbers x, y and shoots all living monsters whose index k
 satisfies k & x = k (& denotes the bitwise AND operator). Each monster he shoots loses y health points.
